## Introduction

The default Laravel application structure is intended to provide a great starting point for both large and small applications. Of course, you are free to organize your application however you like. Laravel imposes almost no restirctions on where any given class is located - as long as Composer can autoload the class.

## The Root Directory

The root directory of a fresh Laravel installation contains a variety of folders:

The `app` directory, as you might expect, contains the core code of your application. We'll explore this folder in more detail soon.

The `bootstrap` folder contains a few files that bootstrap the framework and configure autoloading.

The `config` directory, as the name implies, contains all of your application's configuration files.

The `database` folder contains your database migration and seeds.

The `public` directory contains the front controller and your assets (images, JavaScript, CSS, etc.).

The `resources` directory contains your views, raw assets (LESS, SASS, CoffeeScript), and "language" files.

The `storage` directory contains compiled Blade templates, file based sessions, file caches, and other files generated by the framework.

The `tests` directory contains your automated tests.

The `vendor` directory contains your Composer dependencies.

## The App Directory

The "meat" of your application lives in the `app` directory. By default, this directory is namespaced under `App` and is autoloaded by Composer using the [PSR-4 autoloading standard](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/). **You may change this namespace using the `app:name` Artisan command**.

The `app` directory ships with three additional directories: `Console`, `Http`, and `Providers`. Think of the `Console` and `Http` directories as providing an API into the "core" of your application. The HTTP protocol and CLI are both mechanisms to interact with your application, but do not actually contain application logic. In other words, they are simply two ways of issuing commands to your application. The `Console` directory contains all of your Artisan commands, while the `Http` directory contains your controllers, filters, and requests.

> **Note:** Many of the classes in the `app` directory can be generated by Artisan via commands such as: `make:controller`, `make:filter`, `make:request`, `make:console`, and `make:provider`.

## Namespacing Your Application

As discussed above, the default application namespace is `App`; however, you should change this namespace to match the name of your application, which is easily done via the `app:name` Artisan command. For example, if your application is named "SocialNet", you should run the following command:

	php artisan app:name SocialNet
