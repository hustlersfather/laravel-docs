# API Documentation

## About/Goals

This documentation is meant to replace the automatically-generated docs. The docs try to:

1. Assume little prior knowledge and be welcoming to lower experience levels, prioritizing the needs of the novice.

2. Be brief. Avoid uneeded words and vocabulary.

3. Make good reference and be easily scannable.
