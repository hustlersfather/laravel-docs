## Introduction

Configuration files are stored in the `app/config` directory and are well-commented.

To use environments, enable evironmental detection by entering your machine hostnames in `bootstrap/start.php` under `$app->detectEnvironment`. Run `hostname` in terminal to find your machine's hostname.

    <?php

    $env = $app->detectEnvironment(array(

        'local' => array('your-machine-name'),

    ));

## Acessing Values at Run-Time

You can access the configuration values at run-time using the `Config` class:

#### Accessing A Configuration Value

	Config::get('app.timezone');

You may also specify a default value to return if the configuration option does not exist:

	$timezone = Config::get('app.timezone', 'UTC');

#### Setting A Configuration Value

Notice that "dot" style syntax may be used to access values in the various files. You may also set configuration values at run-time:

	Config::set('database.default', 'sqlite');

Configuration values that are set at run-time are only set for the current request, and will not be carried over to subsequent requests.

## Environment Configuration

It's useful to have different settings in each environment. For example, to use a different cache driver for local development than on the production server. To do this,

1. Create a folder in the `config` directory that matches your environment name, such as `local`. 

2. Create the configuration files you wish to override and specify the options for that environment. For example, to override the cache driver for the local environment, you would create a `cache.php` file in `app/config/local` with the following content:

	<?php

	return array(

		'driver' => 'file',

	);

> **Note:** Do not use 'testing' as an environment name. This is reserved for unit testing.

You do not have to specify _every_ option, only the options you wish to override from the default. The environment configuration files will "cascade" over the base files.

3. Tell Laravel how to determine which environment it is running in. The default is always `production`. However, you may setup other environments within the `bootstrap/start.php` file, under `$app->detectEnvirontment`. You may add environments as needed.

    <?php

    $env = $app->detectEnvironment(array(

        'local' => array('your-machine-name'),

    ));

In this example, 'local' is the name of the environment and 'your-machine-name' is the hostname of your server. On Linux and Mac, you may find your hostname by running `hostname`.

If you need more flexible environment detection, you may pass a `Closure` to the `detectEnvironment` method, allowing you to implement environment detection however you wish:

	$env = $app->detectEnvironment(function()
	{
		return $_SERVER['MY_LARAVEL_ENV'];
	});

#### Accessing The Current Application Environment

Use `environment` to access the current environtment:

	$environment = App::environment();

To see if the environment has certian conditions, you can pass arguments to the `environment` method:

	if (App::environment('local'))
	{
		// The environment is local
	}

	if (App::environment('local', 'staging'))
	{
		// The environment is either local OR staging...
	}

### Provider Configuration

You may "append" environment [service providers](/docs/ioc#service-providers) to your primary `app` configuration file. However, the environment `app` providers may override the providers in your primary `app` configuration. To force the providers to be appended, use the `append_config` helper method in your configuration:

	'providers' => append_config(array(
		'LocalOnlyServiceProvider',
	))

## Protecting Sensitive Configuration

For "real" applications, it is advisable to keep all of your sensitive configuration out of your configuration files. Things such as database passwords, Stripe API keys, and encryption keys should be kept out of your configuration files whenever possible. So, where should we place them? Thankfully, Laravel provides a very simple solution to protecting these types of configuration items using "dot" files.

First, [configure your application](/docs/configuration#environment-configuration) to recognize your machine as being in the `local` environment. Next, create a `.env.local.php` file within the root of your project, which is usually the same directory that contains your `composer.json` file. The `.env.local.php` should return an array of key-value pairs, much like a typical Laravel configuration file:

	<?php

	return array(

		'TEST_STRIPE_KEY' => 'super-secret-sauce',

	);

All of the key-value pairs returned by this file will automatically be available via the `$_ENV` and `$_SERVER` PHP "superglobals". You may now reference these globals from within your configuration files:

	'key' => $_ENV['TEST_STRIPE_KEY']

Be sure to add the `.env.local.php` file to your `.gitignore` file. This will allow other developers on your team to create their own local environment configuration, as well as hide your sensitive configuration items from source control.

Now, on your production server, create a `.env.php` file in your project root that contains the corresponding values for your production environment. Like the `.env.local.php` file, the production `.env.php` file should never be included in source control.

> **Note:** You may create a file for each environment supported by your application. For example, the `development` environment will load the `.env.development.php` file if it exists.

## Maintenance Mode

When your application is in maintenance mode, a custom view will be displayed for all routes into your application. This makes it easy to "disable" your application while it is updating or when you are performing maintenance. A call to the `App::down` method is already present in your `app/start/global.php` file. The response from this method will be sent to users when your application is in maintenance mode.

To enable maintenance mode, simply execute the `down` Artisan command:

	php artisan down

To disable maintenance mode, use the `up` command:

	php artisan up

To show a custom view when your application is in maintenance mode, you may add something like the following to your application's `app/start/global.php` file:

	App::down(function()
	{
		return Response::view('maintenance', array(), 503);
	});

If the Closure passed to the `down` method returns `NULL`, maintenance mode will be ignored for that request.

### Maintenance Mode & Queues

While your application is in maintenance mode, no [queue jobs](/docs/queues) will be handled. The jobs will continue to be handled as normal once the application is out of maintenance mode.
