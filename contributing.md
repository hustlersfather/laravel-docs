# Contribution Guidelines

If you are submitting documentation for the **current stable release**, submit it to the corresponding branch. For example, documentation for Laravel 4.1 would be submitted to the `4.1` branch. Documentation intended for the next release of Laravel should be submitted to the `master` branch.

Documentation for both Laravel 4.1 and the next release should be submitted to the `4.1` branch and it will be merged forward to `master`.
