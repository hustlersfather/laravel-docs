## Configuration

The Laravel Queue component provides a unified API across a variety of different queue services. Queues allow you to defer the processing of a time consuming task, such as sending an e-mail, until a later time, thus drastically speeding up the web requests to your application.

The queue configuration file is stored in `app/config/queue.php`. In this file you will find connection configurations for each of the queue drivers that are included with the framework, which includes a [Beanstalkd](http://kr.github.com/beanstalkd) and synchronous (for local use) driver.

## Basic Usage

To push a new job onto the queue, use the `Queue::push` method:

**Pushing A Job Onto The Queue**

	Queue::push('SendEmail', array('message' => $message));

The first argument given to the `push` method is the name of the class that should be used to process the job. The second argument is array of data that should be passed to the handler. A job handler should be defined like so:

**Defining A Job Handler**

	class SendEmail {

		public function fire($job, $data)
		{
			//
		}

	}

Notice the only method that is required is `fire`, which receives a `Job` instance as well as the array of `data` that was pushed onto the queue.

Once you have processed a job, it must be deleted from the queue, which can be done via the `delete` method on the `Job` instance:

**Deleting A Processed Job**

	public function fire($job, $data)
	{
		// Process the job...

		$job->delete();
	}

If you wish to release a job back onto the queue, you may do so via the `release` method:

**Releasing A Job Back Onto The Queue**

	public function fire($job, $data)
	{
		// Process the job...

		$job->release();
	}

You may also specify the number of seconds to wait before the job is released:

	$job->release(5);

If an exception occurs while the job is being processed, it will automatically be released back onto the queue. You may check the number of attempts that have been made to run the job using the `attempts` method:

**Checking The Number Of Run Attempts**

	if ($job->attempts() > 3)
	{
		//
	}

## Running The Queue Listener

Laravel includes an Artisan task that will run new jobs as they are pushed onto the queue. You may run this task using the `queue:listen` command:

**Starting The Queue Listener**

	php artisan queue:listen

You may also specify which queue connection the listener should utilize:

	php artisan queue:listen connection

Note that once this task has started, it will continue to run until it is manually stopped. You may use a process monitor such as [Supervisor](http://supervisord.org/) to ensure that the queue listener does not stop running.

To process the only the first job on the queue, you may use the `queue:work` command:

**Processing The First Job On The Queue**

	php artisan queue:work
