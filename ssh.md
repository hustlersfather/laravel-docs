## Configuration

Laravel includes a simple way to SSH into remote servers and run commands, allowing you to easily build Artisan tasks that work on remote servers. The `SSH` facade provides the access point to connecting to your remote servers and running commands.

The configuration file is located at `app/config/remote.php`, and contains all of the options you need to configure your remote connections. The `connections` array contains a list of your servers keyed by name. Simply populate the credentials in the `connections` array and you will be ready to start running remote tasks. Note that the `SSH` can authenticate using either a password or an SSH key.

## Basic Usage

#### Running Commands On The Default Server

To run commands on your `default` remote connection, use the `SSH::run` method:

	SSH::run(array(
		'cd /var/www',
		'git pull origin master',
	));

#### Running Commands On A Specific Connection

Alternatively, you may run commands on a specific connection using the `into` method:

	SSH::into('staging')->run(array(
		'cd /var/www',
		'git pull origin master',
	));

#### Catching Output From Commands

You may catch the "live" output of your remote commands by passing a Closure into the `run` method:

	SSH::run($commands, function($line)
	{
		echo $line.PHP_EOL;
	});

## Tasks
<a name="tasks"></a>

If you need to define a group of commands that should always be run together, you may use the `define` method to define a `task`:

	SSH::into('staging')->define('deploy', array(
		'cd /var/www',
		'git pull origin master',
		'php artisan migrate',
	));

Once the task has been defined, you may use the `task` method to run it:

	SSH::into('staging')->task('deploy', function($line)
	{
		echo $line.PHP_EOL;
	});

## SFTP Downloads

The `SSH` class includes a simple way to download files using the `get` and `getString` methods:

	SSH::into('staging')->get($remotePath, $localPath);

	$contents = SSH::into('staging')->getString($remotePath);

<a name="sftp-uploads"></a>
## SFTP Uploads

The `SSH` class also includes a simple way to upload files, or even strings, to the server using the `put` and `putString` methods:

	SSH::into('staging')->put($localFile, $remotePath);

	SSH::into('staging')->putString($remotePath, 'Foo');

## Tailing Remote Logs

Laravel includes a helpful command for tailing the `laravel.log` files on any of your remote connections. Simply use the `tail` Artisan command and specify the name of the remote connection you would like to tail:

	php artisan tail staging

	php artisan tail staging --path=/path/to/log.file
