## Introduction

While Laravel does not dictate which JavaScript or CSS pre-processors you use, it does provide a basic starting point using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Inertia](https://inertiajs.org/), and / or [Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com/) that will be helpful for many applications. By default, Laravel uses [NPM](https://www.npmjs.org) to install frontend packages.

The Tailwind CSS and Livewire / Inertia scaffolding provided by Laravel is located in the `laravel/jetstream` Composer package, which may be installed using Composer:

    composer require laravel/jetstream

Once the `laravel/jetstream` package has been installed, you may install the frontend scaffolding using the `jetstream:install` Artisan command:

    // Generate basic scaffolding...
    php artisan jetstream:install livewire
    php artisan jetstream:install inertia

    // Generate team support scaffolding...
    php artisan jetstream:install --teams

> {tip} To learn more about Laravel Jetstream, please consult the official [Jetstream documentation](https://github.com/laravel/jetstream).

#### CSS

[Laravel Mix](/docs/{{version}}/mix) provides a clean, expressive API over compiling SASS or Less, which are extensions of plain CSS that add variables, mixins, and other powerful features that make working with CSS much more enjoyable. In this document, we will briefly discuss CSS compilation in general; however, you should consult the full [Laravel Mix documentation](/docs/{{version}}/mix) for more information on compiling SASS or Less.

#### JavaScript

Laravel does not require you to use a specific JavaScript framework or library to build your applications. In fact, you don't have to use JavaScript at all. However, Laravel does include some basic scaffolding to make it easier to get started writing modern JavaScript using [Inertia](https://inertiajs.com) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org). Vue provides an expressive API for building robust JavaScript applications using components. As with CSS, we may use Laravel Mix to easily compile JavaScript components into a single, browser-ready JavaScript file.

## Writing CSS

After installing the `laravel/jetstream` Composer package and [generating the frontend scaffolding](#introduction), Laravel's `package.json` file will include Tailwind CSS packages to help you get started prototyping your application's frontend using Tailwind. However, feel free to add or remove packages from the `package.json` file as needed for your own application. You are not required to use the Tailwind framework to build your Laravel application - it is provided as a good starting point for those who choose to use it.

Before compiling your CSS, install your project's frontend dependencies using the [Node package manager (NPM)](https://www.npmjs.org):

    npm install

Once the dependencies have been installed using `npm install`, you can compile your CSS files using [Laravel Mix](/docs/{{version}}/mix#working-with-stylesheets). The `npm run dev` command will process the instructions in your `webpack.mix.js` file. Typically, your compiled CSS will be placed in the `public/css` directory:

    npm run dev

The `webpack.mix.js` file included with Laravel's frontend scaffolding will compile the `resources/css/app.css` file. This `app.css` file contains the proper starting configuration for Tailwind CSS. Feel free to customize the `app.css` file however you wish.

## Writing JavaScript

When using the Jetstream Inertia scaffolding, all of the JavaScript dependencies required by your application can be found in the `package.json` file in the project's root directory. This file is similar to a `composer.json` file except it specifies JavaScript dependencies instead of PHP dependencies. You can install these dependencies using the [Node package manager (NPM)](https://www.npmjs.org):

    npm install

Once the packages are installed, you can use the `npm run dev` command to [compile your assets](/docs/{{version}}/mix). Webpack is a module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. When you run the `npm run dev` command, Webpack will execute the instructions in your `webpack.mix.js` file:

    npm run dev

By default, the Laravel `webpack.mix.js` file compiles your CSS and the `resources/js/app.js` file. Your compiled JavaScript will typically be placed in the `public/js` directory.

> {tip} The `app.js` file will load the `resources/js/bootstrap.js` file which bootstraps and configures your basic JavaScript dependencies. If you have additional JavaScript dependencies to configure, you may do so in this file.
