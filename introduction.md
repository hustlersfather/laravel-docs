## Where To Start

Learning a framework can be daunting, but exciting. To help, we've tried to create clear, concise documentation. Here is some recommended first reading:

- [Installation](/docs/installation), [Configuration](/docs/configuration) and [Databases](/docs/database)
- [Routing](/docs/routing)
- [Requests & Input](/docs/requests)
- [Views & Responses](/docs/responses)
- [Controllers](/docs/controllers)

After reading these, you should have a good grasp on basic request / response handling in Laravel. Next, you may wish to read about the [fluent query builder](/docs/queries), and the [Eloquent ORM](/docs/eloquent). Or [authentication and security](/docs/security) so you can start signing people into your application.

## Laravel Philosophy

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, and caching.

Laravel aims to make the development process a pleasing one for the developer without sacrificing application functionality. Happy developers make the best code. To this end, we've attempted to combine the very best of what we have seen in other web frameworks, including frameworks implemented in other languages, such as Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET MVC, and Sinatra.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.

## What is a framework?

A framework is the "scaffolding" and methodology of a software project. It's the file and folder hierachy, functions and ways of thinking. 

For example, imagine you have the source code (the HTML/PHP files and folders) to the popular website [Apple.com](http://apple.com) and you want to use them to make a blog. You can see that it has a lot of great functions and organization, but also a lot of things you don't need. If you strip out the content and leave just the functions and other tools, you essentially have a framework.

Laravel has done this for you. It applies the best practices and designs to create the bare-bones of a powerful web application.
