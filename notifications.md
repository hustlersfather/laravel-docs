## Introduction

In addition to support for [sending email](/docs/{{version}}/mail), Laravel provides support for sending notifications across a variety of delivery channels, including mail, SMS (via [Nexmo](https://www.nexmo.com/)), [Slack](https://slack.com), and database tables. Notifications may also be stored in a database so they may be displayed in your web interface.

Typically, notifications should be short, informational messages that notify users of something that occurred in your application. For example, if you are writing a billing application, you might send an "Invoice Paid" notification to your users via the email and SMS channels.

### Driver Prerequisites

#### SMS

The default SMS driver is powered by [Nexmo](https://www.nexmo.com/) and requires the Nexmo PHP client, which may be installed via the Composer package manager:

    composer require nexmo/client

#### Slack

The Slack notification driver requires the Guzzle HTTP library to make API requests to Slack. You can install Guzzle via Composer:

    composer require guzzlehttp/guzzle

## Writing Notifications

In Laravel, each notification is represented by a single class (typically stored in the `app/Notifications` directory). Don't worry if you don't see this directory in your application, it will be created for you when you run the `make:notification` Artisan command:

    php artisan make:notification InvoicePaid

This command will place a fresh notification class in your `app/Notifications` directory.

Notification classes contain two important methods: `via` and `message`. The `via` method returns an array of channels that the notification should be delivered through. The `message` method builds the notification message.

<a name="message-structure"></a>
### Message Structure

Each notification message may have two parts: "lines" of texts and a "call to action". To illustrate this, let's take a look at an example `message` method for an `InvoicePaid` notification:

    /**
     * Get the notification message.
     *
     * @param  \Illuminate\Notifications\Message  $message
     * @return \Illuminate\Notifications\Message
     */
    public function message(Message $message)
    {
        return $message->line('One of your invoices has been paid!')
                    ->action('View Invoice', 'https://example.com/invoice/'.$this->invoice->id)
                    ->line('Thank you for using our application!');
    }

We register a line of text, a call to action, and then another line of text. Each notification channel will translate this structure into a format that makes sense for it. When using the `mail` channel, for example, the notification will be translated into a nice, responsive HTML email template. When using the `nexmo` channel, it will be formatted into a simple text message.

Here is an example of an email generated by the `mail` channel:

<img src="https://laravel.com/assets/img/notification-example.png" width="551" height="596">

Note we are using `$this->invoice->id` in our `message` method. You may pass any data your notification needs to generate its message into its constructor.

<a name="error-notifications"></a>
### Error Notifications

Some notifications tell users about errors, such as an invoice payment failing. You may say that a notification is about an error by calling the `error` method when building your message. Some notification channels will use this information to customize the appearance of the notification. For example, when using the `mail` channel, the call to action button will be red instead of blue:

    /**
     * Get the notification message.
     *
     * @param  \Illuminate\Notifications\Message  $message
     * @return \Illuminate\Notifications\Message
     */
    public function message(Message $message)
    {
        return $message->error()
                    ->subject('Notification Subject')
                    ->line('...')
    }

<a name="sending-notifications"></a>
## Sending Notifications

Notifications may be sent in two ways: with the `notify` method of the `Notifiable` trait or the `Notification` [facade](/docs/{{version}}/facades). First, let's examine the `Notifiable` trait. It is used by the `User` model by default and has one method that may be used to send notifications, `notify`. Pass it a notification instance:

    $user = App\User::find(1);

    $invoice = App\Invoice::find(1);

    $user->notify(new App\Notifications\InvoicePaid($invoice));

Alternatively, you may send notifications via the `Notification` facade. This is useful primarily when you need to send a notification to multiple "notifiable" entities such as a collection of users:

    Notification::send($users, new InvoicePaid($invoice));

> {tip} Remember, you may use the `Illuminate\Notifications\Notifiable` trait on any of your models. You are not limited to only including it on your `User` model.

<a name="determining-delivery-channels"></a>
### Determining Delivery Channels

Every notification class has a `via` method that determines on which channels the notification will be delivered. Out of the box, notifications may be sent on the `mail`, `nexmo`, `slack`, and `database` channels.

The `via` method receives a `$notifiable` instance, which will be an instance of the class to which the notification is sent. You may use `$notifiable` to determine which channels the notification should be delivered on (though this is not always necessary):

    /**
     * Get the notification channels.
     *
     * @param  mixed  $notifiable
     * @return array|string
     */
    public function via($notifiable)
    {
        if ($notifiable->prefers_sms) {
            return ['sms'];
        } else {
            return ['mail', 'database'];
        }
    }

<a name="via-mail"></a>
### Via Mail

When sending notifications via the `mail` channel, the notification system will automatically look for an `email` property on your notifiable entity. You may customize which email address is used to deliver the notification by defining a `routeNotificationForMail` method on the entity:

    <?php

    namespace App;

    use Illuminate\Notifications\Notifiable;
    use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;

    class User extends Authenticatable
    {
        use Notifiable;

        /**
         * Route notifications for the mail channel.
         *
         * @return string
         */
        public function routeNotificationForMail()
        {
            return $this->email_address;
        }
    }

#### Customizing The Subject

By default, the email's subject is the class name of the notification put in "title case". So, if your notification class is named `InvoicePaid`, the email's subject will be `Invoice Paid`. If, instead, you would like to specify a subject for the message, you may call the `subject` method when building your message:

    /**
     * Get the notification message.
     *
     * @param  \Illuminate\Notifications\Message  $message
     * @return \Illuminate\Notifications\Message
     */
    public function message(Message $message)
    {
        return $message->subject('Notification Subject')
                    ->line('...')
    }

<a name="via-sms"></a>
### Via SMS

#### Configuration

Sending SMS notifications in Laravel is powered by [Nexmo](https://www.nexmo.com/). Before you can send notifications via Nexmo, you need to install the `nexmo/client` Composer package and add a few configuration options to your `config/services.php` configuration file. You may copy the example configuration below to get started:

    'nexmo' => [
        'key' => env('NEXMO_KEY'),
        'secret' => env('NEXMO_SECRET'),
        'sms_from' => '15556666666',
    ],

The `sms_from` option is the phone number that your SMS messages will be sent from. You may generate a phone number for your application in the Nexmo control panel.

#### Routing Nexmo SMS Notifications

When sending notifications via the `nexmo` channel, the notification system will automatically look for a `phone_number` attribute on the notifiable entity. If you would like to customize the phone number the notification is delivered to, define a `routeNotificationForNexmo` method on the entity:

    <?php

    namespace App;

    use Illuminate\Notifications\Notifiable;
    use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;

    class User extends Authenticatable
    {
        use Notifiable;

        /**
         * Route notifications for the Nexmo channel.
         *
         * @return string
         */
        public function routeNotificationForNexmo()
        {
            return $this->phone;
        }
    }

<a name="via-slack"></a>
### Via Slack

Before you can send notifications via Slack, you must install the Guzzle HTTP library via Composer:

    composer require guzzlehttp/guzzle

Then define a `routeNotificationForSlack` method on your notifiable entity. This should return the webhook URL to which the notification should be delivered. Webhook URLs may be generated by adding an "Incoming Webhook" service to your Slack team:

    <?php

    namespace App;

    use Illuminate\Notifications\Notifiable;
    use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;

    class User extends Authenticatable
    {
        use Notifiable;

        /**
         * Route notifications for the Slack channel.
         *
         * @return string
         */
        public function routeNotificationForSlack()
        {
            return $this->slack_webhook_url;
        }
    }

<a name="via-database"></a>
### Via Database

#### Creating The Database Table

The database notification channel stores the notification information in a database table. You can query the table to display the notifications in your application's user interface. But, before you can do that, you will need to create a database table to hold your notifications. Use the schema definition below to create a table:

    Schema::create('notifications', function (Blueprint $table) {
        $table->increments('id');
        $table->string('notifiable_type');
        $table->integer('notifiable_id');
        $table->string('level', 25);
        $table->text('intro');
        $table->text('outro');
        $table->string('action_text')->nullable();
        $table->string('action_url')->nullable();
        $table->boolean('read');
        $table->timestamps();

        $table->index(['notifiable_type', 'notifiable_id']);
    });

#### Accessing The Notifications

The `Illuminate\Notifications\Notifiable` trait includes a `notifications` Eloquent relationship method that returns the notifications for the notifiable entity. To fetch notifications, you may access this method like any other Eloquent relationship. By default, notifications will be sorted by the `created_at` timestamp:

    $user = App\User::find(1);

    foreach ($user->notifications as $notification) {
        echo $notification->action_text;
    }

If you only want the "unread" notifications, you may use the `unreadNotifications` relationship. Again, these notifications will be sorted by the `created_at` timestamp:

    $user = App\User::find(1);

    foreach ($user->unreadNotifications as $notification) {
        echo $notification->action_text;
    }

#### Marking Notifications As Read

Typically, you will want to mark a notification as "read" when a user views it. The `Illuminate\Notifications\Notifiable` trait provides a `markAsRead` method, which updates the `read` column on the notification's database record:

    $user = App\User::find(1);

    foreach ($user->notifications as $notification) {
        $notification->markAsRead();
    }

You may also use a mass-update query to mark all of the notifications as read:

    $user = App\User::find(1);

    $user->notifications()->update(['read' => true]);

Of course, you may `delete` the notifications to remove them from the table:

    $user->notifications()->delete();

<a name="queueing-notifications"></a>
### Queueing Notifications

> {note} Before queueing notifications, configure your queue and [start a queue worker](/docs/{{version}}/queues).

Sending notifications can take time, especially if the channel needs an external API call to deliver the notification. To speed up your application's response time, let your notification be queued by adding the `ShouldQueue` interface and `Queueable` trait to your class. The interface and trait are already imported for all notifications generated using `make:notification`, so you may immediately add them to your notification class:

    <?php

    namespace App\Notifications;

    use Illuminate\Bus\Queueable;
    use Illuminate\Notifications\Message;
    use Illuminate\Notifications\Notification;
    use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;

    class InvoicePaid extends Notification implements ShouldQueue
    {
        use Queueable;

        // ...
    }

Once the `ShouldQueue` interface has been added to your notification, you may send the notification like normal. Laravel will detect the `ShouldQueue` interface on the class and automatically queue the delivery of the notification:

    $user->notify(new InvoicePaid($invoice));

If you would like to delay the deliver of the notification, you may chain the `delay` method onto your notification instantiation:

    $when = Carbon::now()->addMinutes(10);

    $user->notify((new InvoicePaid($invoice))->delay($when));

<a name="notification-events"></a>
## Notification Events

When a notification is sent, the `Illuminate\Notifications\Events\NotificationSent` event is fired by the notification system. This contains the "notifiable" entity and the notification instance itself. You may register listeners for this event in your `EventServiceProvider`:

    /**
     * The event listener mappings for the application.
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $listen = [
        'Illuminate\Notifications\Events\NotificationSent' => [
            'App\Listeners\LogNotification',
        ],
    ];

> {tip} After registering listeners in your `EventServiceProvider`, use the `event:generate` Artisan command to quickly generate listener classes.

Within an event listener, you may access the `notifiable` and `notification` properties on the event to learn more about the notification recipient or the notification itself:

    /**
     * Handle the event.
     *
     * @param  NotificationSent  $event
     * @return void
     */
    public function handle(NotificationSent $event)
    {
        // $event->notifiable
        // $event->message
    }

<a name="custom-channels"></a>
## Custom Channels

Laravel ships with a handful of notification channels, but you may want to write your own drivers to deliver notifications via other channels. Laravel makes it simple. To get started, define a class that contains a `send` method. The method should receive two arguments: a collection of `$notifiables` and a `$notification` instance:

    <?php

    use App\Channels;

    use Illuminate\Support\Collection;
    use Illuminate\Notifications\Message;

    class VoiceChannel
    {
        /**
         * Send the given notification.
         *
         * @param  \Illuminate\Support\Collection  $notifiables
         * @param  \Illuminate\Notifications\Message  $notification
         * @return void
         */
        public function send(Collection $notifiables, Message $message)
        {
            foreach ($notifiables as $notifiable) {
                // Send notification to the $notifiable instance...
            }
        }
    }

Once your notification channel class has been defined, you may simply return the class name from the `via` method of any of your notifications:

    <?php

    namespace App\Notifications;

    use Illuminate\Bus\Queueable;
    use App\Channels\VoiceChannel;
    use Illuminate\Notifications\Message;
    use Illuminate\Notifications\Notification;
    use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;

    class InvoicePaid extends Notification
    {
        use Queueable;

        /**
         * Get the notification channels.
         *
         * @param  mixed  $notifiable
         * @return array|string
         */
        public function via($notifiable)
        {
            return [VoiceChannel::class];
        }

        /**
         * Get the notification message.
         *
         * @param  \Illuminate\Notifications\Message  $message
         * @return \Illuminate\Notifications\Message
         */
        public function message(Message $message)
        {
            // ...
        }
    }
