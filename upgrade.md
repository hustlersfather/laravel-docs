### PHP 7.3.0 Required

**Likelihood Of Impact: Medium**

The new minimum PHP version is now 7.3.0.

<a name="updating-dependencies"></a>
### Updating Dependencies

Update your `laravel/framework` dependency to `^8.0` in your `composer.json` file.

Finally, examine any other third-party packages consumed by your application and verify you are using the proper version for Laravel 8 support.

#### Closure Routes Caching

**Likelihood Of Impact: Low**

Laravel 8 introduces caching of the closure-based routes. It will not affect you in any way, unless you override or use in your code directly `Illuminate\Routing\Route::prepareForSerialization`, which otherwise is used only in the `route:cache` command by the framework.

The change implemented in this method is adding support for serialization of the closure and is mutating `Route::$action['uses']` value.

### Miscellaneous

We also encourage you to view the changes in the `laravel/laravel` [GitHub repository](https://github.com/laravel/laravel). While many of these changes are not required, you may wish to keep these files in sync with your application. Some of these changes will be covered in this upgrade guide, but others, such as changes to configuration files or comments, will not be. You can easily view the changes with the [GitHub comparison tool](https://github.com/laravel/laravel/compare/6.x...master) and choose which updates are important to you.
