## Upgrading To 5.8.0 From 5.7

#### Estimated Upgrade Time: TBD

> {note} We attempt to document every possible breaking change. Since some of these breaking changes are in obscure parts of the framework only a portion of these changes may actually affect your application.

### Updating Dependencies

Update your `laravel/framework` dependency to `5.8.*` in your `composer.json` file.

Of course, don't forget to examine any 3rd party packages consumed by your application and verify you are using the proper version for Laravel 5.8 support.

### Database

#### Unquoted MySQL JSON Values

**Likelihood Of Impact: Low**

The query builder will now return unquoted JSON values when using MySQL and MariaDB. This behavior is consistent with the other supported databases:

    $value = DB::table('users')->value('options->language');

    dump($value);

    // Laravel 5.7...
    '"en"'

    // Laravel 5.8...
    'en'

As a result, the `->>` operator is no longer supported or necessary.

#### SQLite

**Likelihood Of Impact: Medium**

As of Laravel 5.8 the [oldest supported SQLite version](https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/25995) is SQLite 3.7.11. If you are using an older SQLite version, you should update it (SQLite 3.8.8+ is recommended).

### Exception Handling

#### The `renderHttpException` Method

**Likelihood Of Impact: Low**

The `renderHttpException` method signature of the `Illuminate\Foundation\Exceptions\Handler` class [has changed](https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/25975). If you are overriding this method in your exception handler, you should update the method signature to match its parent:

    /**
     * Render the given HttpException.
     *
     * @param  \Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Exception\HttpExceptionInterface  $e
     * @return \Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response
     */
    protected function renderHttpException(HttpExceptionInterface $e);

### Facades

#### Facade Service Resolving

**Likelihood Of Impact: Low**

The `getFacadeAccessor` method may now [only return the string value representing the container identifier of the service](https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/25525). Previously, this method may have returned an object instance.

### Asserts

#### Images

**Likelihood Of Impact: Low**

- [Separated 401 and 403 error images.](https://github.com/laravel/laravel/pull/4814). So, you should add 401 error image to your app.

### Routing

#### The `UrlGenerator` Contract

**Likelihood Of Impact: Very Low**

The `previous` method [has been added to the `Illuminate\Contracts\Routing\UrlGenerator` contract](https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/25616). If you are implementing this interface, you should add this method to your implementation.

### Miscellaneous

We also encourage you to view the changes in the `laravel/laravel` [GitHub repository](https://github.com/laravel/laravel). While many of these changes are not required, you may wish to keep these files in sync with your application. Some of these changes will be covered in this upgrade guide, but others, such as changes to configuration files or comments, will not be. You can easily view the changes with the [GitHub comparison tool](https://github.com/laravel/laravel/compare/5.7...master) and choose which updates are important to you.
